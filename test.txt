This is a test file for get next line.
I'm going to use this file to test if I'm able to write a function that returns the next line of a given text.
I'm not sure if I'm able to do this.
The stakes are too high and my hands are shaking.
Getting the next line seems like an impossible task but I need to succeed... I MUST succeed. My whole life depends on in. Hell... the fate of the whole world depends on it.
I can't let others down.
The only way to redemption is through coding.
Now... I must start...
